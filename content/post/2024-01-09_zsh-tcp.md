I switched from Bash to <abbr>ZSH</abbr> as my default shell after discovering the amazing [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh] project.
It wasn’t a particularly well researched or thought through decision.
oh-my-zsh just made <abbr>ZSH</abbr> look cool (plugins!) and pretty (themes!), which was enough.

So, it’s kind of funny that ever since writting [“One Line Reverse Shell in Bash”][reverse-shell-in-bash], I felt a bit disappointed by <abbr>ZSH</abbr>.
I mean, why does my “cool” shell has no pseudo-devices for <abbr>TCP</abbr> connections?
They seem fun:

```
$ (printf >&4 "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n"; \
   head <&4 --lines 20) 4<>/dev/tcp/example.com/80
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<head>

    <meta charset="utf-8" />
```

Here, as far as I understand, a sub-shell gets a read-write[^1] file descriptor `4` pointing at `example.com:80`.
We send an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> <abbr>GET</abbr> request by writing to `4` with `printf`.
Then we read the first 20 lines of the response (including headers) from `4` with `head`.
Bash automatically resolves the domain name into an <abbr>IP</abbr>[^2] address, opens a <abbr>TCP</abbr> socket to port 80, and then closes it after we are done.
Amazing!

Well, recently I learned that <abbr>ZSH</abbr> has ✨modules✨.
Its [documentation page][zsh-modules-docs] describes them as “optional parts” that “may be linked in to the shell at build time, or can be dynamically linked while the shell is running”.
Modules are loaded (“linked”, I guess?) with `zmodload` command.

There’s one module that immediately caught my attention — `zsh/net/tcp`.
When loaded, it adds a single new command `ztcp` and it’s exactly what I wanted!

Here’s how to make the same <abbr>GET</abbr> request to `example.com:80` but with `ztcp`:

```
% zmodload zsh/net/tcp

# open the socket
% ztcp -d 4 example.com 80

% printf >&4 "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n"

% head <&4 --lines 20
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

Admittedly, not as succint as pseudo-devices in Bash.
Although, I like that it’s less “magical” and seems more “googleable”.

Additionally, `ztcp`, unlike devices in Bash (as far as I know), can also be used to _listen_ for incoming connections.
Here’s a little experiment.

Start accepting connections on port 8181 in <abbr>ZSH</abbr>:
```
% ztcp -v -l 8181
8181 listener is on fd 11

% ztcp -v -a 11 # blocks
```

The last command blocks waiting for a client.
In a different terminal start a Bash session and send the request:

```
$ (echo >&4 "Hello, ZSH?"; \
   head <&4 --lines 1) 4<>/dev/tcp/localhost/8181 # blocks
```

Now, `head` in Bash blocks waiting for the response, but over on the <abbr>ZSH</abbr> side we accepted a connection and can read from it:

```
% ztcp -v -a 11
39980 is on fd 3

% head <&3 --lines 1
Hello, ZSH?
```

Send the response:
```
% echo >&3 "Hello, Bash!"
```

This unblocks `head`, which prints the greeting and exits:

```
$ (echo >&4 "hello, ZSH?"; \
   head <&4 --lines 1) 4<>/dev/tcp/localhost/8181
Hello, Bash!
```

Finally, let’s not forget to close the sockets opened with `ztcp`:

```
% ztcp -c 3
% ztcp -c 11
```

Just two shells communicating over a <abbr>TCP</abbr> connection with no extra tools required.
How cool is that?

So, am I going to uninstall `curl` or `wget` any time soon?
Of course, the answer is no.
But, it is nice to know that `ztcp` is there for me when I need something simple yet not constrained by protocols like those tools are.
_Maybe_ I can replace `netcat`[^3] with it?

[^1]: I think, because this is not a regular file, you can’t really open it only for reading or writing, so `4>/dev/tcp/...` and `4</dev/tcp/...` variants also work
[^2]: According to `strace`, it even tries <abbr>IPv6</abbr> first, before falling back to <abbr>IPv4</abbr>
[^3]: Or is it `ncat`? Or `nc`? … `netcat-traditional`?
