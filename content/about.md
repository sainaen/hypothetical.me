## Blog

This is a blog about things in programming that I've found interesting enough to write down,
with occasional non-technical posts.

It has two primary objectives:

* help me learn to communicate better
* work as an external memory --- store things I once knew

There's no comments section for now, but you're welcome to send your feedback
to [ivan@vyshnevskyi.com](mailto:ivan@vyshnevskyi.com) or
tweet at [@sainaen](https://twitter.com/sainaen).

## Author

I'm a software engineer living in Kyiv, Ukraine.

*// TODO: write more(?)*


## PS

Even as I'm writing this I can't stop imagining how funny this all will look on
yet another abandoned site with a handful of old posts.
Hopefully this blog [will be different!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias)
