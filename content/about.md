Hi!

My name is Ivan, and I’m a software engineer currently living in Kyiv, Ukraine.

This blog is about things in and around programming that I’ve found
interesting enough to write down, with occasional non-technical posts.

It has two primary goals:

* help me learn to communicate better, and
* work as an external memory&#8239;---&thinsp;store things I once knew.

There’s no comments section for now, but you’re welcome to send your feedback
to [ivan@vyshnevskyi.com](mailto:ivan@vyshnevskyi.com) or
tweet at [@sainaen](https://twitter.com/sainaen).
